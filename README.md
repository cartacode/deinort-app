We're using this approach to develop the [Flutter app](https://github.com/invoiceninja/flutter-mobile/) for [Invoice Ninja](https://www.invoiceninja.com).

## Usage

#### Step 1: Clone the GitHub repo

`git clone git@github.com:hillelcoren/flutter-redux-starter.git <application> && cd <application>`

#### Step 2: Initialize the project

`./starter.sh init <company> <application> <url>`

#### Step 3: Create the module

`./starter.sh make <application> <module> <fields>`

For example:

```
git clone git@github.com:hillelcoren/flutter-redux-starter.git hacker_news && cd hacker_news
./starter.sh init hacker_news articles api.hackerwebapp.com
./starter.sh make articles article title,url
# Change the route on line 20 of lib/data/repositories/article_repository.dart from /articles to /news
flutter run
```

Note: on macOS sed leaves behind backup files ending with `-e`, you can use this command to delete the files:

`find . -name "*-e" -type f -delete`

## Features

- Supports large Redux stores by persisting parts separately
- App state (including navigation) is persisted on form changes
- Automatically implements support for sorting and searching
- The account email is also backed up in shared preferences
- All state and models classes are created using built_values
